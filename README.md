# Lab-1
 
Lab 1 introduced us to the concept of motor control using a microcontroller. The source code developed controls a DC motor, allowing it to rotate in both directions. The GPIO pin assignments for turning on the motor (EN), adjusting the direction (IN1 and IN2), and setting up a timer for PWM control are initialized in the MotorDriver class. Users can control both the direction and torque of the motor by setting its duty cycle with the set_duty_cycle function. The motor rotates in one direction when CH1 is set to zero and CH2 is set to a positive duty cycle, the opposite direction when CH2 is set to zero and CH1 is set to a positive duty cycle, andÂ it stops when the duty cycle is zero for both channels. The value of the variable "level" is used to determine the direction that the motor should be rotating. When greater than zero, it rotates in one direction. When less than zero, it rotates in the other direction. When equal to zero, the motor comes to a stop.
